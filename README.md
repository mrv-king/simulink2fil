# DESCRIPTION
These four folders represent supplimentary materials for a scientific paper with the title ["Towards the Automatic Transformation of the SIMULINK Model into an FPGA-in-Loop System and its Real-Time Simulation"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10439197). The paper represents a step-by-step approach for the synthesis of a MATLAB/SIMULINK model into HDL. As such, the original idea of the paper is the transformation of a SIMULINK model into a so-called FPGA-in-the-loop system where the FPGA can work as a simulator where the SIMULINK model is processed.
